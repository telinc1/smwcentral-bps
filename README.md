# SMW Central BPS patching library

[![Latest Stable Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@smwcentral/bps)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@smwcentral/bps)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/@smwcentral/bps)](https://github.com/telinc1/smwcentral-bps/blob/master/LICENSE)

The JavaScript BPS patching library used by [SMW Central](https://www.smwcentral.net), most notably for its [Online
Tools](https://github.com/SMWCentral/OnlineTools) section.

## Installation

### NodeJS

Install from NPM using your favorite package manager:

```shell
$ npm install @smwcentral/bps
$ pnpm add @smwcentral/bps
$ yarn add @smwcentral/bps
```

You can then import the library as an ES module:

```js
import * as bps from "@smwcentral/bps";
```

TypeScript declarations are built in.

### Browser (CDN)

You can import the module directly from a CDN:

```html
<script type="module">
    import * as bps from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@smwcentral/bps@1.0.0/dist/index.js";
</script>
```

For convenience, use an import map:

```html
<script type="importmap">
    {
        "imports": {
            "@smwcentral/bps": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@smwcentral/bps@1.0.0/dist/index.js"
        }
    }
</script>

<script type="module">
    import * as bps from "@smwcentral/bps";
</script>
```

## Usage

### Apply BPS patch

The `applyBPS` function directly applies a BPS patch, with the base file and patch represented as a `Uint8Array` or
equivalent.

```js
import {readFileSync, writeFileSync} from "node:fs";
import {applyBPS} from "@smwcentral/bps";

const base = readFileSync("base.bin");
const patch = readFileSync("patch.bps");

const result = applyBPS(base, patch);

writeFileSync("result.bin", result);
```

If patching fails, `PatchError` will be thrown:

-   `MalformedPatchError`: The patch is not a BPS patch
-   `WrongInputSizeError`: The input file has a wrong size
-   `WrongInputChecksumError`: The input file has a wrong checksum

### Apply BPS patch adaptively

The `adaptiveApplyBPS` function applies a BPS patch and attempts to make adaptations to the input file. The optional 3rd
arguments allows you to tweak which adaptations are enabled (by default, everything is enabled).

```js
import {readFileSync, writeFileSync} from "node:fs";
import {adaptiveApplyBPS} from "@smwcentral/bps";

const base = readFileSync("base.bin");
const patch = readFileSync("patch.bps");

const result = adaptiveApplyBPS(base, patch, {
    trySMC: true,
    trySMB2: true,
});

writeFileSync("result.bin", result);
```

The following adaptations are currently supported:

-   `trySMC`: If enabled, a patch made for a headerless SNES ROM (.sfc) can be applied to a headered input ROM (.smc).
    In this case, the result will be a headered ROM (.smc). Note that patches generated by
    [Flips](https://git.disroot.org/Sir_Walrus/Flips) (such as most BPS patches on SMW Central) are typically based on a
    headerless ROM, even if the original base ROM was headered.
-   `trySMB2`: If enabled, patches made for Super Mario Bros. 2 can be applied to any commonly used ROM (Rev 0, Rev 0 in
    NES 2.0 format, and Rev A), no matter the combination of patch and input ROM.
